Signal Station Simulator

Signal Station is a New Haven railroad term for what others might call
a Signal Tower or Signal Box.  This simulator uses Microsoft Train
Simulator (MSTS) compatible routes and equipment to display trains
passing by.  Most features follow past north american railroad practice
with automatic signals between manually controlled interlockings.
Some features also support manual block signalling.
