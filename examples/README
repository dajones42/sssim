To use these examples you must already have the correspond MSTS content
installed somewhere.  The content is all available from the train-sim.com
file library.  It isn't known if MSTS needs to be installed.

To install the examples, create a sssim directory in the corresponding route's
directory and copy the example files into it.

To run them: open a terminal window, navigate to the directory that contains
the sssim code and run "nw ." (add the full path to nw if needed).  After
opening the json file you may want to scroll down to the map display to
figure out which lever controls which switches and signals.

The bftt66s1 example represents a 7 AM to 3 PM shift for the Bellows Falls
ball signal operator.  It is based on B&M ETT 66 (April 27, 1958),
CV ETT 52 (October 26, 1958), Rutland ETT 119 (September 25, 1949),
B&M Freight Train Symbol Book 51 (April 30, 1950), and B&M
Passenger Train Consists January 1, 1956.  For a Northbound train to
cross the single track: levers 7, 5 and 3 must be reversed.  For a
Southbound train: levers 8, 10, 9 and 3 must be reversed.  The Rutland
used manual block rules.  A Block For button will appear before a
southbound Rutland train will start.  Click the button and the reverse
lever 1 when the train appears.  For a northbound Rutland trains:
click the Request Block button and the reverse lever 2.

The ss28shift1 example represents a 7 AM to 3 PM shift for the operator
at SS28 (between Cos Cob and Greenwich) on the New Haven.  It is based on
a PTT from May 12, 1968, Passenger Train Consists October 28, 1962 and
Freight Train Schedule April 25, 1965.
Usually all black levers should be normal and all blue levers should be
reversed.  For westbound trains on track 1 and 3, levers 19 and 20,
repectively, should be reversed.  For eastbound trains on tracks 2 and 4,
levers 2 and 1, respectively, should be reversed.  To send a train from
track 1 to track 3: levers 19, 20 and 12 need to be normal; then levers
11, 12 and 19 can be reversed.  To send a train from track 3 to track 1:
levers 19, 20 and 10 need to be normal; then levers 9, 10 and 20 can be
reversed.

The ss44shift2 example represents a 3 PM to 11 PM shift for the operator
at SS44 in South Norwalk on the New Haven.  It is based on "The Classic
Railway Signal Tower" by Stephen McEvoy and the documents listed above.
SS44 is preserved as the SoNo Switch Tower Museum.  The lever numbers match
the New Haven usage as much as possible, but some tracks don't exist in
the Metro North route.  Usually all black levers should be normal and
all blue levers should be reversed.  For westbound trains on track 1:
levers 57, 65 and 67 should be reversed.  For westbound trains on track 3:
levers 58, 66 and 68 should be reversed.
For eastbound trains on tracks 2: levers 4, 2 and 6 should be reversed.
For eastbound trains on tracks 4: levers 3, 1 and 5 should be reversed.
To send a train from track 2 to track 4: levers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 28 must be
normal; then levers 27, 28, 4 and 2 can be reversed.
To send a train from track 1 to track 3: levers 68, 67, 66, 65 and 40 must
be normal; then levers 39, 40, 65 and 67 can be reversed.
To send a train from the Danbury branch to track 3: levers 68, 66 and 47
must be normal; then levers 48, 47, 64 and 59 can be reversed.
To send a train from track 5 to the Danbury branch: levers 68, 66, 47 and
41 must be normal; then levers 42, 41, 48, 47, 12 and 15 can be reversed.
To send a train from track 4 to the Danbury branch: levers 5, 6, 68, 66,
67, 65, 47, 37, 36 and 33 must be normal; then levers 34, 33, 35, 36, 37,
38, 48, 47, 5 and 15 can be reversed.
To send a train from track 4 to track 1 to reverse direction: levers 5, 6,
67, 65, 36 and 33 must be normal; then levers 34, 33, 35, 36 and 5 can be
reversed.
